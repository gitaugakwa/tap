# Decisions log

Append-only. **Never edit or delete a row.** To change a decision, add a new row that says `Supersedes Dxx`. Anything marked 🔒 elsewhere changes only through a new row here, agreed by both teammates, in the same commit as the change.

| # | Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D01 | 09-26 | Expo **dev build** (EAS), not Expo Go | NFC needs native modules; Expo Go only runs bundled ones |
| D02 | 09-26 | Merchant = Android (HCE emulates); customer = Android (reads); iPhone customer is a stretch | iOS card emulation needs an Apple commercial entitlement; iPhones can read |
| D03 | 09-26 | The tap carries only the signed *request*; settlement is onchain on an L2 | True Suica is offline stored value; spending limits/session keys are future work |
| D04 | 09-26 | **ENS: Best Use of ENSv2** is the anchor bounty | Merchant identity is the core problem |
| D05 | 09-26 | Curvegrid/MultiBaas dropped; the merchant watches `Paid` directly with viem | No backend needed |
| D06 | 09-26 | Uniswap out unless re-added by a new decision (then FEEDBACK.md + form) | Scope |
| D07 | 09-26 | Currency is **USDC** on Base Sepolia, not a mock JPY token | Real token with permit |
| D08 | 09-26 | ENS parent `tap.eth` (backup `tappay.eth`) | Short, on-brand |
| D09 | 09-26 | ENS on Sepolia, payments on Base Sepolia | ENSv2 is Sepolia-only; Base has ~2s blocks |
| D10 | 09-26 | Build `pay` + `payWithPermit`; demo permit | One tx for the user; `pay` keeps the SDK token-agnostic |
| D11 | 09-26 | TypeScript + viem + Foundry; native Kotlin/Swift SDKs post-hackathon | Speed |
| D12 | 09-26 | **Bun** (runtime, package manager, workspaces, tests) + **Hono** for any server | Team preference |
| D13 | 09-26 | Biome for lint/format; `bun test` for TS tests | One fast tool each, Bun-native |
| D14 | 09-26 | UI: pending → green only after onchain success; full visual design deferred | Loop first |
| D15 | 09-26 | TapPay exposes `hashRequest` + `PAYMENT_REQUEST_TYPEHASH`; shared `hash-vector.json` | Hash-parity test prevents TS/Solidity drift |
| D16 | 09-26 | Merchant subnames issued by our **`TapMerchantRegistrar`** on our own ENSv2 **UserRegistry** under `tap.eth`, with EAC roles (registry `ROLE_REGISTRAR`, resolver `ROLE_SET_ADDRESS` + `ROLE_SET_TEXT`) | Makes ENSv2 features central (bounty requirement); binds names to addresses at issuance |
| D17 | 09-26 | Display name comes from the ENS text record `name`, never from the tag | The tag is untrusted |
| D18 | 09-26 | Registration is free, permissionless, first-come; subnames never expire (`type(uint64).max`) | Hackathon simplicity; squatting noted as a gap with a "What's next" fix |
| D19 | 09-26 | Merchants receive only `ROLE_SET_RESOLVER` on their subname | Least privilege, with a path to self-managed records later |
| D20 | 09-26 | Folder names describe contents: `apps/mobile` (not `apps/demo`); `packages/core/src/{config,request,verify,payment,wallet,testing}`; `packages/react-native/src/{merchant,customer}` | Intuitive structure (team request) |
| D21 | 09-26 | `VerifyFailure` includes `network_error`; `verifyRequest` never throws and never treats a network failure as verified | Fail closed with clear copy |
| D22 | 09-26 | `@tap/core/testing` ships `createFakeCore()`; hooks accept an injectable `core` | Lets the Flow track build the UI before chain code lands |
| D23 | 09-26 | ENS setup (proxies, roles, registrar deploy) lives in `scripts/`, not in the SDK | SDK stays read-mostly; setup is a one-off admin job |
| D24 | 09-26 | Small commits (one logical change, ≤ ~150 lines), a four-section commit message, protected flows P1–P7 | Team request: no regressions, visible impact per change |
| D25 | 09-26 | **No AI attribution** in commits or PRs; enforced by `.claude/settings.json`, the commit-msg hook and CI | Team request |
| D26 | 09-26 | `getPaymentChain` re-exported from `@tap/core` (`index.ts`) so `apps/mobile` can display the deployed TapPay address in Settings → About | Read-only accessor; the address stays in `chains.ts` (INV-15), the app keeps holding no addresses (INV-14) |
| D27 | 09-26 | ~~`ITapResolver` is `setAddr(bytes32 node, …)`~~ / `setText(bytes32 node, …)`, and `TapMerchantRegistrar` writes records against the **ENS namehash**, not a DNS-encoded name. Supersedes the `setAddress(bytes name, …)` reference implementation in `docs/03`. (D26 is claimed by the in-flight `flow/app-shell` PR.) | The installed `contracts-v2` `PermissionedResolver` keys records by `node` and uses it as the EAC authorization key (`onlyPartRoles(node, …)`), so a DNS-encoded name would not authorize or store correctly. Adapting to the installed interface is exactly what `docs/03`'s ENSv2 warning instructs. Also found: the resolver role constant is `PermissionedResolverLib.ROLE_SET_ADDR`, not `ROLE_SET_ADDRESS` as `docs/04` assumes (same value, `1 << 0`) |
| D28 | 09-26 | **Supersedes D27.** `ITapResolver` is `setAddress(bytes name, …)` / `setText(bytes name, …)` taking a **DNS-encoded name**, exactly as `docs/03` originally specified, and `TapMerchantRegistrar` takes `bytes parentDns`. D27 was wrong | D27 was derived from the `contracts-v2` source vendored in `lib/`, which is *newer than the resolver actually deployed on Sepolia*. The live resolver implementation (`0x14F09Fd0…`, the one `tap.eth` resolves through) has no `setAddr(bytes32,…)` selector at all; it has `setAddress(bytes,…)`. Verified by simulating both forms as the registrar against the live contract: the `bytes32` form reverts, the `bytes` form succeeds. When source and deployment disagree, the deployment wins |
| D29 | 09-26 | Public request and deep-link host is **`tap-pay.xyz`**; request URLs use `https://tap-pay.xyz/p` | We acquired and control the domain, replacing the temporary `tap.xyz` placeholder |
| D30 | 09-26 | F1 passed with a Samsung Galaxy S23 (`SM-S911U1`, Android 16) serving HCE and Galaxy A56 5G (`SM-A566B`, Android 16) reading: 10/10 chooser-free reads under 2 seconds with Google Wallet as default; the locked HCE phone did not read | Validates NFC for the demo while preserving the expected unlocked, foreground-only operating constraint |
| D31 | 09-26 | **Supersedes D06.** Add Uniswap exact-output payments through an additive `TapSwapPay` adapter: the merchant still signs an exact USDC request, while the customer may fund it with native ETH or a supported standard ERC-20 through a bounded Base Sepolia route. Direct USDC remains the default path | Preserves the proven request, ENS, `TapPay`, NFC/QR and merchant-watch invariants while making the payer's input asset flexible; Permit2 scopes ERC-20 authorization to the adapter, amount and request expiry |
| D32 | 09-26 | Start A2 before P1-P7: deploy `apps/server` to Railway with a landing page at `/`, a fail-closed app handoff at `/p`, and an APK link to the latest GitHub Release asset | Gives `tap-pay.xyz` a safe public destination now without displaying unverified request data; live web verification and automated signed APK publishing remain later work |
| D33 | 09-26 | Implement A3 as a self-service mobile flow using the existing device wallet; registration waits for one Sepolia confirmation, while faucet links remain external and copy the wallet address first | Keeps private keys on-device, preserves the registrar's first-come model, and avoids custody or a new backend |
| D34 | 09-26 | Android customer devices accept `https://tap-pay.xyz/p` through both a verified App Link and legacy NFC `NDEF_DISCOVERED`; OS launches pass the untouched URL into the existing fail-closed verification flow | Supports chooser-free home-screen taps across Android versions without trusting or rendering tag data before `verifyRequest` succeeds |
